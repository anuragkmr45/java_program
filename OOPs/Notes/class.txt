1. Class - Template for an object
Object - an instance of a class

A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects
Class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality.

2. Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
state - value from its data type
identity - distinguishes one object from another, It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.
behavior - the effect of data-type operations

3. Dot operator(.) - links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable
