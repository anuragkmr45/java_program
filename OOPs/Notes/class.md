- <b>Class</b> -> Template for an object<br>
<b>Object</b> -> an instance of a class<br>
A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects<br>
Class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality.

- Objects are characterized by three essential properties: <b>state</b>, <b>identity</b>, and <b>behavior</b>.<br>
<b>State</b> -> value from its data type<br>
<b>identity</b> -> distinguishes one object from another, It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.<br>
<b>behavior</b> -> the effect of data-type operations<br>

- Dot operator(.)</b> -> links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable
